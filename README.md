# xerocross.check (2018)

This was an app for creating checklists written circa 2018. A checklist is not
a to-do list. Rather, the idea was to create named, reusable checklists
such as "Morning Routine" for example.

This app is **not maintained**. It will no longer build in a modern development environment&mdash;something to do with node-sass. Fixing and modernizing this app is not a priority.

## Technology

 I'm writing this in June 2023, so this project is essentially found technology to me even though I wrote all of it.

 This app was built on Vue 2. Aside from that, I hand-rolled the scripts, including a module that at the time I called "cross-js-base": https://github.com/xerocross/cross-js-base, on which I offset the task of maintaining state in the browser's local storage.

 I barely remember my methods or motives from 2018, but I know that I often considered it useful to hand-roll my own scripts in vanilla JavaScript for **practice**&mdash;not because I thought I could do it better than battle-tested libraries.
